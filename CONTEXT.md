# Recipe Retrieval

A searchable store of the Shengtao/recipe dataset that supports two ways of finding recipes from a text query: sparse retrieval and dense retrieval.

## Language

**Recipe**:
One row of the source dataset: a single dish with its title, description, ingredients, directions and metadata.
_Avoid_: Document, record, item

**Chunk**:
A piece of one Recipe's text that is the unit both sparse and dense retrieval rank. Every Chunk belongs to exactly one Recipe and carries that Recipe's title.
_Avoid_: Passage, segment, document

**Summary chunk**:
The Chunk made of a Recipe's title and description.

**Ingredients chunk**:
The single Chunk holding a Recipe's full ingredient list. Ingredients are never split per line.

**Step chunk**:
A Chunk holding a run of consecutive text from a Recipe's directions, in its original order. Where the run starts and ends is the only thing that differs between Chunking strategies; Summary and Ingredients chunks are the same under every Chunking strategy.
_Avoid_: Direction chunk, instruction

**Chunking strategy**:
The named method that turned Recipes into Chunks: fixed-size, sentence-based or semantic, each with its parameters (e.g. 56 tokens per Chunk). A Chunking strategy is built once, offline; changing its parameters means a new name. Chunks from different Chunking strategies can coexist and are never mixed within one search. A Chunking strategy is searchable only once it is loaded: every Recipe has its complete set of Chunks under it.
_Avoid_: Chunker, splitter

**Sparse retrieval**:
Finding recipes by matching query terms against their text, ranked by BM25.
_Avoid_: Keyword search, full-text search, lexical search

**Dense retrieval**:
Finding recipes by comparing the embedding of the query to embeddings of recipe text, ranked by vector similarity.
_Avoid_: Semantic search, vector search, embedding search

**Filter**:
A condition on a Recipe's structured attributes (category, time, rating, nutrition) that narrows the candidates before ranking.
_Avoid_: Facet, constraint

**Hybrid retrieval**:
Finding recipes by running Sparse and Dense retrieval on the same query, merging their two rankings into one by rank position, then Reranking the merged candidates. Reranking is always part of Hybrid retrieval and never applied to Sparse or Dense alone.
_Avoid_: Fusion search, combined search

**Reranking**:
Re-scoring a short list of candidate Chunks by reading the query and each Chunk's text together, and reordering them by that score.
_Avoid_: Re-ranking, second-stage ranking
